drupack
======================

> _TODO_

## Installation
This theme should be used as a starting point for new custom themes. 
Because of this, the theme has no `composer.json` file and dependencies 
should be added to the project this theme is created in.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/wieni/drupack.git public/themes/custom/drupack
composer require wieni/bunny
```
